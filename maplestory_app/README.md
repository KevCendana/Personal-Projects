# Maplestory App
I wanted to learn how to use Flutter and Dart, so I decided to make a basic app that replicates the core gameplay of **Maplestory, one of my favorite childhood games ♡( ◡‿◡ )

It was fun practice for understanding and using widgets, utilizing state management, asynchronous programming, UI layout and design, and some simple animation & interaction.
